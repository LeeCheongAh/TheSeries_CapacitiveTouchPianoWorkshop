# TheSeries_CapacitiveTouchPianoWorkshop
Capacitive Touch Piano on the Arduino for The Series Workshop

This sketch was written for a Series workshop. These workshops are intended for people who are newer to the world of Arduino and programming in general, 
and serve as a fun and interactive way for them to gain some exposure. In this particular sketch, different notes are played depending on which capacitive 
touch "sensor" (piece of foil) is pressed. This allows the user to create a capacitive touch piano (with poor timbre).
